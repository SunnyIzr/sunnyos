For example, I work in policy where I interpret gray areas of the rules and advise desks on structuring transactions in a capital efficient way. We trained a model on the regulations and quickly noticed it produced inaccurate outputs, which in our world could lead a desk to make a decision that ties up significant capital unnecessarily. Once we saw that risk, we tightened access because we do not want traders relying on an LLM as if it were a policy expert, so for now it functions more like a very controlled research assistant than a decision maker.

Thank you for that insight, I'm always super curious about how different industries are adapting, i'm particularly interested in finance. Based on what you're saying it looks like there's a long way to go, which actually is a relief. The pace of adoption in the tech sector IMO is way too fast and almost seems reckless. I think it makes sense that financial companies will take a more conservative approach. I just hope that the pressure from the tech sector doesn't compromise that.  Btw I finished my second agentic AI session yday. The first session (last week) was kind of a flop, I think i was attempting to fit too much into it, but the second one seems to have gone a lot smoother.   Once I get the echo360, I will send over.",INBOX,,No,No

I was at conferences all last week and when I got back, JPM had just launched internal personal AI agents for employees.  Right now they are honestly not great, but I saw an internal demo showing the longer term vision. They are aiming for agents that can book time off, manage calendar invites, and handle basic administrative tasks.

Unfortunately I will not be able to attend today as I am heading to the Bitcoin Investor Week conference downtown. Please do share the recording.  On your question about agentic AI, JPM has not rolled it out broadly yet and many teams are still figuring out how to use the firm’s internal LLM, which is actually quite strong. Some advisor teams are already using it for onboarding and portfolio guidance and an EMBA colleague at JPM recently showed me what she is building, so it has not been rolled out broadly but certain areas of the firm are already using it.",INBOX,,No,No

I'm SO sorry for the late reply, your feedback is  not harsh all, in fact I tremendously value it. As you can imagine, it's hard for me to know when i'm coming off too foundational or too advanced, so this is a good reminder.  You are actually not the first person to mention this. I'm going to start incorporating links to previous videos where I talk about foundational concepts. Also I've decided add more foundational content more generally. Another thing I'm noodling on, is creating a site that links to different parts of my youtube content but in a more linear sequence, so that way for someone who may want to learn the basics, they'll know where to start.

I’m still going through the content, but I really like how you lay out a plan at the start so I know what to prepare for in each video. The plan board and overall structure are great, and the quality of the content is strong. It’s helpful to see the full vision of where the video is going.  One small piece of feedback as I continue watching: it might help to slow down a bit at the beginning with a super basic 101, or even briefly link back to earlier videos where those concepts are explained. For example, front end vs back end, what Lovable is, and how everything connects, even something as simple as what’s happening when a user logs in (depending on the audience your targeting) That grounding would make it easier. I found myself pausing the video to do research. ",INBOX,,No,No

Since then, after taking a little hiatus, I’ve resumed working on it while Tina has moved onto bigger and better things. :-)  I really like your product experience at AmEx and I would LOVE to show some screens to get your feedback on my prototype. Let me know if you’d be open to that, and I can show you some more details on the product direction.  Let me know.  Thanks, Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

I wanted to share that my upcoming book Beyond Belief is coming out in a few months.  I’ve spent the past six years writing this book and it's the most meaningful work I’ve ever done. The process pushed me to rethink everything I thought I knew about pain, perception, and performance.  Early readers like Steven Bartlett (“I wish I’d read this 10 years ago”) and Derek Thompson (“I absolutely devoured it”) have loved the book.  Preorders make a huge difference; they influence bestseller lists, Amazon rankings,  bookstore orders, and even media interest.

Ive been meaning to reach out, especially after listening to your podcast. I’ve been reducing my social media footprint and literally Linkedin is now the channel I’m most active on so figured i’d reach out to you here.  How have you been? I loved the podcast, it honestly was so inspiring to hear and learn about all the cool things you’ve been up to!  I’ve been doing the start up thing, now onto my fourth. I left NYC to move in with my parents in Sept ‘22 to pursue my latest startup (trying to fundraise and live a gay nyc lifestyle proved impossible). But just moved back to the city last month, fortunately triumphantly, we were able to close our round. I’m now living in astoria.  I feel like we don’t have many social links in common anymore, i’ve lost touch with majority of the people that we shared in common from the old days. Other than Vito tho! I see him from time to time and he fills my heart with bliss!  I was so excited to hear about what you’re doing with Tondo Park, would love to help in any way. And just generally would love to catch up sometime! I’ll be in TX for SXSW next week but around later in march/early-April.  Let me know.  -Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

As I mentioned, I’m organizing a CTO Summit at the Nasdaq on Tuesday December 5th. I’m an ex-CTO, it’s a labor of love and the presenters include CTOs from Reddit, Meetup.com, Flatiron Health, Vimeo, Ellevest, LaunchDarkly, RainforestQA and the NY Times.  It’s a single track, full day (8am-7.30pm) event designed for and by engineering leaders. It’s a great way to connect with and learn from your peers dealing with the hard issues around attracting, managing and scaling software engineering teams. We’re holding it at (and in conjunction with) the Nasdaq at their Marketsite location in Times Square.  The best part of the summits is the attendees. While the speakers are amazing, the attendees are often people who would be presenting at other conferences. Given that, I think you'd make a great addition to the event so I’d love to personally offer you a 30% discount off of admission to get you involved, and if for any reason cost is still an issue, drop me a line and I’ll do my best to come up with something that’ll allow you to attend the conference.

So timing-wise, this worked out perfectly, and now I get to spend that time during the summer with pay. So all in all, I'm enjoying myself!  I was also able to see this coming, since I was leading the growth area of the business, and could see the cracks forming. The market was not quite resonating with our offer given the current economic conditions, so we were very behind on our ambitious growth goals. So I figured around the Q2 investment call, we'll most likely be sold off 😀  More than 70% of my area was affected, which is the part that is painful. These are not low performers.

At SimCase, our simulations are developed through partnerships with Wharton, Kellogg, and Harvard Business Publishing. What makes them effective is that they focus on a single teaching point, which keeps them short and makes them easy to integrate into an existing syllabus. Like all simulations, they boost student engagement by allowing students to learn by doing in realistic business scenarios.   I’d love to set you up with free trial access to our catalog, and if you’re relatively new to simulations, I’d be happy to schedule a brief demo as well.

I joined the company (https://clarivate.com/life-sciences-healthcare/) in October. One of our corporate goals for 2025 was to fully incorporate AI in our products/solutions (we have a Saas-based portfolio) - which has been kicked off and going ok to well to too slow - depends on who you are talking to. MY remit is to upskill our team, and we have a mixed back of users, ranging from the ""never used"" to ""everyday user"". We also have a host of issues ranging from a lack of governance to nebulosity re: usage and policies, no knowledge management, no use-case support... in short, we are supremely lacking. Most users have the free Copilot with our MS 365, and only a very few have the Pro version. Needless to say, output with the free version is poor. I myself prefer Claude, even the free version.   All this to say that I would love to have an exploratory conversation with you. Caveat #1 being that an internal team has already short listed 3 vendors/training partners - Eularis, Intuitionlabs and Founderz - for AI literacy and culture transformation - but nothing has moved ahead on that front. Caveat #2 - the CEO of our group has allocated a budget (hashtag#s are fluid) but haven't signed off on one yet. My agenda, if you will, for a call with you will be for research, and not hiring (yet, unless a budget appears!).  This week is packed already but would love 30 mins with you next week, if you are amenable. Please provide me with your availability for a Teams call. My email is maya.viswanath@clarivate.com and I am in EST.   Looking forward to hearing from you.  My best, Maya",INBOX,,No,No

I am well and still in NYC.

Since I don't have a technical background, he's hoping I'll quarterback this project over the next 3 months  I'm thinking of it in two buckets: (1) the operational side (investor relations, reporting, one-page marketing materials etc.) > low-hanging fruit and (2) his research / investment process > how can he integrate AI tools in a meaningful, structured, repeatable, trustworthy way.   I realize the above is quite vague so I asked him to put some structured language around what he's looking to accomplish but hopefully that gives you some idea. My exposure to AI is quite limited (your Python for MBAs class, AI for Business, and GenAi at CBS), so I too am trying to get better at integrating AI tools into my daily workflow.

Not sure if you remember, but we met a while back when we were both doing the co-founder-searching thing. Huge congrats on all the success with AI Furnace, it’s been really cool to see how far it’s come over the years.  I’m sure you already have most of the speaker lineup figured out for the AI Summit, but I just applied today. I actually realized I’d accidentally submitted a draft version last week that was incomplete, so I just wanted to flag that, if my submission is considered, I’m hoping it’s based on the updated version I sent in today.  Since we last spoke, I’ve been up to a lot:  - Building Lightswitch, my venture-backed startup that’s creating the monetization layer for consumer ai products. - Continuing as Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School, where I’m teach MBA students some of the foundational ai technologies, the course enrollment has grown exponentially given all the developments in ai - I've also been involved in some cool ai consulting projects where i'm working with fortune 500 companies, leading talks and trainings on how they adopt agentic ai and ai in general - And finally I’ve also launched a YouTube channel to help early-stage builders navigate ai product development, been a fun way to bring everything full circle.

Sorry man, this semester got hectic so quick and I'm constantly in catch-up mode. I just watched the ""From Idea to Live App FAST Tutorial (No Code Needed | Lovable + Supabase)"" and ""Build a Real App in 20 Minutes Tutorial (Pomodoro for Writers | Lovable + Supabase)"" videos. I think they're great! The pace is perfect. The descriptions you've provided for each tool and their respective value is very clear. I think the prompt/app choices you've picked for creation are also very easy to follow. One thing I'm curious about is pricing for the use of all these tools. So if I were to become a builder (novice vs intermediate vs full-time developer), how much would it cost to utilize these subscriptions? Just in case it serves as another barrier to entry. I think you mentioned the supabase project cost in the video but could be good to see it in the video description as well",INBOX,,No,No

Hope you are well. Wanted to give you a brief update:  After nearly five years of working on Clasp, we made the decision to dissolve the company. We arrived at this decision over the course of several months and did a ton of soul searching to get to this point. I first conceived the idea of Clasp back in 2015 and in our view the initial market hypotheses just don’t hold up in a post-2020 world. Although these decisions are never easy, we feel ready to turn the page.  Since closing Clasp, I’ve been heavily involved in the crypto/blockchain space. My experience as a fintech founder, former financial analyst on Wall Street and as a senior engineer (formerly at Bloomberg), I feel I am very well positioned to tackle this space. After cutting through all the hype and learning more about the actual underlying technologies, I have no doubt that the the level of innovation is undeniable.   In any case, I wanted to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for being one of our supporters over the years. Also, I know you’ve recently moved to back to Insider, congrats! I am here to answer any questions within the crypto space as well as fintech in general should any arise. :-)  Best, Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

How are things going with you? What have you been up to these days?  A lot has changed on my end over the past year, thought I'd share: • My team and I officially made the decision to dissolve my personal finance app company, Clasp. We had a good run, but we just don’t feel as passionate about our market hypothesis anymore. I initially conceived the idea of Clasp in 2015, but the world just seems like an entirely different place today than it did back then!  • Also, I got a new job, I left Bloomberg and have been with Shopify since May, really amazing company, and learning a ton.  • And finally, I’m thinking about my next venture. I've been doing a ton of technical due diligence in the blockchain/DeFi space and I'm pretty impressed with what I've been seeing. It made me think of you as I know that you’ve been pretty passionate about the crypto space.  Would love to grab coffee sometime (virtual or in-person if you're in NYC).",INBOX,,No,No

It's a new trend now.  I commend you on building your brand though! The branding and product looks top tier and it seems like you're doing a good job creating buzz.  I'm around the next couple of weeks in case you want to catch up for a virtual coffee!,INBOX,,No,No

I am SO excited that you’re focused on hyperpigmentation for people with darker complexion!  This is something I’ve been struggling with since i was literally in my early 20s, particularly under my eyes. For a very long time, i thought I was aging prematurely and spent exorbitant amounts of money on everything in the market and of course nothing worked.  Finally a desi dermatologist enlightened me to the fact that this was not due to aging and actually genetic for brown people. Nowadays I stopped using things on the market for under eyes because it’s clear that nothing out there seems to be focused on people with darker complexion. So my mom and I make this homemade ointment that has turmeric in it lol  But I am super excited about your company and definitely interested in trying it out!

A bit about me—most recently, I was Head of Product at a TravelTech startup, taking it from zero to launch and through a Series B. Before that, I spent seven years advising corporates on how to operate in a leaner, more entrepreneurial way to innovate their products and business models. Now, I’m focused on helping startups with growth, product strategy, and market fit.  I’d love to hear what challenges you’re facing at this stage and what’s standing in the way of your next big leap. And if anything from my experience—customer research, product incubation, or scaling—could be useful, I’d be happy to share.

The workshop is focused on facilitating the interaction between our current students and professionals working in different areas of Wall Street. It is a wonderful opportunity for our alumni to introduce students to their areas of finance, what they do on a day-to-day basis, their career paths, the skill set required to enter their area, and any other professional advice they can provide to students.

Quick background for context: I recently built and sold one of my companies in less than 18 months, growing from $0 revenue to a $50m+ exit. This remarkable growth was powered by focusing on:  Vision: Giving love and attention to the company's vision. Flow: Creating a healthy and happy environment for employees. Surrender: Letting go of subconscious blockers to success.  This approach led to growing from 1 employee to 120 with 0 turnover, all through internal referrals.  Now, I'm looking to form a community of like-minded leaders who are interested in these unconventional but powerful methods. You’re the type of person I’d want to be a part of this community, so I want your opinion…  Is this something that might be of interest to you or your colleagues? Please let me know your first thoughts—I’d really appreciate it!  Looking forward to your thoughts.  Troy Lavinia Co-Founder and CEO",INBOX,,No,No

Hope you've been well.  Quick update on my end, we are chugging along with my startup, Lightswitch. Not sure if I mentioned, but we were able to finally close our fundraise in Feb, as you can imagine it was a long process but so happy we got through the finish line.  We’re pretty early in our customer development so trying to be as judicious as possible with the capital we’ve raised. That said, we’re starting to have early conversations with potential founding engineers. Again, we’re not in the position to hire in the near future, but would love to have conversations with people who possibly share the vision. We’re looking to speak with engineers on the more junior side, mostly due to financial constraints. I was wondering if you knew any junior engineers who you think highly of. I’d love to chat with them.

So to give you a bit more color, I'm working on pricing and packaging optimizer for digital saas companies.

And in turn having that JS SDK render onboarding flows on top of those UIs.  Basically, I'm trying to make working with our product as easy as possible which is why I'm investing in building a client-side SDK that renders onboarding flows. These flows would be used to onboard subscribers onto a more optimized pricing and packaging construct.  I know that Brightback was solving a completely different problem (ie retention), but what I was curious about is how they went about rendering those retention flows on top of their customer's UIs.

I was introduced to you and Doris by Nik Sathe. How have you been?  Since then, my career has come a long way. I ended up going on to start that personal finance startup, Clasp but ultimately shut it down in 2021. Now I’m onto my latest start up (my fourth one actually), but this time in the subscription payments space. We just closed our pre-seed round last week.  I see you’ve come a long way since AmEx, it’s been inspiring to see your trajectory over the years. I love what you've done with Lean.  If you’re up for it, I’d love to do coffee (virtual since we’re on different coasts) to talk shop, especially given your experiences in payments. Let me know if you’re down to catch up.

Not sure if you remember me but we were in the same Product Management class at General Assembly way back in 2016. It’s been really amazing to see your trajectory with Knock! At the time I was working on a personal finance startup called Clasp. Since then I ended up shutting down Clasp and now onto my latest start up (my fourth one actually), called Lightswitch.  We just raised our pre-seed round and now thinking through the technical roadmap. Our vision is to modernize subscription billing for digital consumer subscription companies. And part of what we’re building is a React/JS based SDK that would render various UI experiences overlaid on top of our customer’s UIs. This approach may not be too dissimilar to Knock’s in-app messages.  If you’re open to it, I’d love to chat with you or someone from your engineering team about how y’all have implemented your SDK. I’m realizing there aren’t a lot of industry standards on this topic. Let me know!  -Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

Cool to hear about the early stage opportunity. What are the cofounders' backgrounds? I can't really say there have been many hard resources (books, blog posts etc) that I have used to ""be a CTO"". Personally, the title ""CTO"" in an early stage company (including Nuvocargo) is a little bit silly and overblown. For the first 9 months, I was basically a cofounder and ""engineer #1"" — a builder, rather than a ""CTO"". For the next 9 months, I was still building, but also playing ""engineering manager"" as our team was growing. For the last year, the majority of my time has been spent on growing our technical teams from a few people to dozens of people while playing a bit of a technical architect/mentor role. I wouldn't overthink the role or title to begin with. In early stage companies ""CTO"" basically just means you're the most technical person in the company and you're going to do whatever needs to be done to help the company succeed from a technical lens.",INBOX,,No,No

The company is a VERY early stage start up, they JUST raised a seed round and only have the two original founders working full time at present.

So I’m sure you know, but DBC is closing :-(, I’ve ultimately decided to look into engineering roles at FinTech startups. I actually have a phone interview scheduled for next week at my dream company Ellevest. I’m interviewing with someone you seemed to be connected with, Kenneth Lay, who I believe you worked with at HowAboutWe.  The interview is designed to gauge my Ruby skills and will be on the phone. Since most of my career has been entrepreneurial, I’m pretty rusty when it comes to technical interviews like this. You were such a phenomenal instructor at DBC, so I’d love to know any tips, tricks or resources that you would recommend.

Right now, our engineering department solely consist of me and me alone. But we’re fundraising right now, and hoping by the end of the year I’ll be in a position to start hiring a small but lean and mean team!   I’ve worked within many different engineering organizations, Bloomberg, Shopify to name a few. And over my career, I’ve seen things that work and a lot of things that didn’t work.  I’m excited about having the opportunity to get it right from the beginning in terms of culture, processes and tools. My vision for my start up’s engineering culture is to really cultivate a community similar to what my students felt when they were going through DBC, but of course in a more professional context.

I actually taught as a lead instructor at DBC in New York for a year and a half back in 2017 and I feel like that experience alone gave me a ton of confidence in managing engineers although more on the junior side. I think what I’m feeling the most imposture syndrome on is my technical abilities. While I feel good about my abilities in creating MVPs, I feel like I’m soft on scaling my products. Also I’ve had some really terrible experiences as a software engineer at big tech companies (specifically Bloomberg and Shopify, in fact I got terminated from Shopify last summer believe it or not, which really messed up my confidence).   But yes would love to learn more about how you’re running your engineering team, in terms of the process and day-to-day. And above all how you’re going about ensuring that code quality is maintained especially as you scale. I feel like at these early stages, there is such a pressure for rapid iteration which of course comes at the expense of cutting corners around code quality, and managing this tension is precisely what I’m starting to think about.

Of course I remember you!! I’m so flattered that you’re reaching out for advice! I was honestly a little nervous stepping into a CTO role, but my years as an IC and manager served me pretty well and it’s not that hard to run a small engineering team. The real hard part is letting people go who don’t meet your expectations. In terms of books, I haven’t read any that are explicitly geared towards CTOs (I probably should!).

Not sure if you remember me, but we both attended Dev Bootcamp about 10 years ago (wow can’t believe it’s that long). I believe you were in Phase 3 when I was in Phase 1, my cohort was the Tiger Swallowtails.  I’ve been following along on your success originally with Reddit and now DwellWell and firstly just want to offer my congratulations. You have accomplished SO much since DBC and it’s been so inspiriting to observe.  I’m actually in the process of building a start up myself, in the fintech payments space—I’m CTO/Technical Co-Founder on this venture. We’re currently fundraising and we’re hoping to close our pre-seed round in the next six months.  Admittedly, while I’ve had many engineering roles and started a few companies before, I’m still a bit nervous stepping into this CTO role especially in the context of a venture backed start up. We started working on this venture since last summer, and so far by day-to-day has really just been that as Engineer #1 where I’ve built out the entire product solo. But once we get funding, I’ll have to take a step further into more of a CTO role.  I was wondering if you knew of any resources (books, sites, groups, etc) that could help me prepare for being CTO. I’m particularly looking for guidance on best practices around identifying who to hire, general recruiting, and best practices around running a small and lean engineering team.  Let me know!

The discussion panel revolved around making payments more seamless and I posed a question on what we can do to mitigate the behavioral effects that seamless payments would inevitably have on consumer’s ability to spend responsibility.  Sure enough, the primary motivation for me posing that question was to discuss a personal finance product that I was in the beginning stages of building at the time, Clasp. As a result you connected me with product leaders at AmEx (Doris Daif and Tilak Joshi specifically) and thanks to you it kicked off a series of productive conversations with AmEx and ultimately changed the trajectory of Clasp. Thank you again for that.  Ultimately, I shut down Clasp last summer and decided to go deeper into building real tools that can help better protect consumers from overspending. I’m now working on a product in the payments space that has consumer’s best interest at heart and having aligned with a rockstar CEO, I’m coming in as CTO.  Given your incredible career (especially your footprint in the payments space), I’d love to chat more about what I’m working if your schedule permits.  Here’s some more details: lightswitch breaks open the subscription economy. We're payments and identity infra that makes it fair and easy for anyone to pay or get paid for services. Our first release is a free payments tool for subscribers that automatically pauses your monthly subscriptions-- never forget to cancel a subscription ever again.   https://www.getlightswitch.com/  Best, Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

Not sure if you remember me, but we connected a couple of times when you were at RRE regarding my personal finance startup called Clasp (www.clasp.app). It’s been some time since we last connected, here’s a quick update:  After nearly five years of working on Clasp, we’ve made the decision to dissolve the company. We arrived at this decision over the course of several months and did a ton of soul searching to get to this point. I first conceived the idea of Clasp back in 2015 and in our view the initial market hypotheses just don’t hold up in a post-2020 world. Although these decisions are never easy, we feel ready to turn the page.  As for my next venture, instead of going it alone, I'm looking to join a robust founding team at the super early stages ideally in the FinTech space. If any teams come across your desk that you feel I would be a good fit for, please keep me in mind! I bring not only founder experience, having founded three companies, but also engineering experience, as I’ve served in senior engineering roles at top tier tech companies.  Lastly, wanted to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude for providing such actionable advice during the times we did connect, it really has meant the world to me!

Our mission is to connect and create role models of gay business leaders to seek inspiration and network to achieve our personal definition of success.

One client in particular just raised $100m in Series C funding, one of the fastest growing AI start-ups in the US, and is now building out their engineering department to begin scaling their multi-product SaaS suite. In this role you would build new products, features, and services within a highly collaborative and team oriented environment and will also learn best practices to perfect your ability to deliver high quality, scalable solutions on the cloud.  This client is able to compensate between 100-200k for their Mid/Sr/and Staff level candidates with the appropriate experience, the ability to work remotely or hybrid if living near their Boston office, and provides full health benefits to all its employees.  Are you available either today or the next few days to talk in more detail about this position or any of the other RoR roles available?

I see that you are a software engineer and love entrepreneurship. I found you via Y combinator's founder matching program and wanted to reach out to you on here! I have a unique idea of an online insurance app that delivers a new way to pay for insurance in today's world.  I want to see if you are interested in teaming up on the venture as a co-founder and CTO?  There will be no more monthly premiums with this new kind of insurance product.  Example: Have you ever wanted auto insurance without paying a monthly premium? That is what this new insurance product would deliver. People get to have insurance without realizing they are paying for it.  You have most insurance companies that charge a high monthly calculated premium in which many people can't afford & you have other insurance companies that charge per mile in which no one wants to track how much they drive to afford their insurance every month. I have another unique way to pay for a policy that is affordable & more practical for anyone to have a policy with us.  Food for thought: ""Global insurance premiums now top $5 trillion annually. Capture just 1% of that, and you have a $50 billion revenue stream. Secure just 0.1% and it's still $5 billion.""

Wanted to give you a brief update:  After nearly five years of working on Clasp (clasp.app), we made the decision to dissolve the company. We arrived at this decision over the course of several months and did a ton of soul searching to get to this point.

Although these decisions are never easy, we feel ready to turn the page.  Since closing Clasp, I’ve been heavily involved in the crypto/blockchain space. My experience as a fintech founder, former financial analyst on Wall Street and as a senior engineer (formerly at Bloomberg), I feel I am very well positioned to tackle this space.

We ease the friction of starting a company by providing the idea(s) to our entrepreneurs, matching you with a co-founder, and investing seed capital ($1M) on Day 1. 3. Founder vs employee equity provides the opportunity to make a life changing amount of money even at a moderate outcome.  I'm reaching out because we are looking for a CTO for one of our next investments. You have a great background for the opportunity. Are you interested in learning more?   Look forward to hearing from you!  Bridget  Bridget Flaherty Talent Lead at Fractal Software",INBOX,,No,No

In queer spaces, there is strong rejection of capitalism, and many within the community do not feel safe in traditional personal finance spaces. These factors have resulted in an overall apathy towards anything personal finance.  Heres’ why the importance of financial literacy in the LGBT community cannot be stressed enough: 1. There are still many political challenges that the LGBT community face in the US despite the progress we’ve made in the media landscape. Economic power is political power. 2. Many LGBT friendly neighborhoods have been subject to gentrification across the country therefore it simply costs more money sustain a lifestyle in an LGBT friendly locale. 3. Still to this day, many in the LGBT community are estranged from their families which underscores the need to have a financial nest egg especially through retirement.  I started a Tiktok (@themoneygay) and am struck at the positive response to personal finance advice being administered from a gay voice. As someone who started my career on Wall Street, never thought I’d see the day that my queer identity would actually enhance my financial authority!  If you’re interested in diving deeper, I’m happy to provide more commentary on this as well as access to members in the LGBT community within my network who are ready to discuss!

I’m very satisfied with the work-life balance at Shopify. We can be pretty aggressive about trying to ship, but managers and execs have always been conscientious of the need to take time off and encourage folks to take time off. This is especially true since the pandemic, where folks tended to work longer hours because there was nothing else to do. I took a week off a couple weeks ago because my manager brought up in our 1-on-1 that I hadn’t taken any days this year and he wanted to be sure I was taking the time to recharge.  As for work hours, I’ve personally maintained a basic 9 am to 5 pm schedule. Most of my team is still located in the Bay, so I’m two hours ahead, and it’s kind of nice to have some really focused work time without distractions, and my team knows that at 3pm their time, I’m going to be logging off.",INBOX,,No,No

I’m following up on my previous message to see if we could schedule an introductory call in the coming days.  As touched on in my previous note, I am keen to understand if there may be interest in our nearshore software development and engineering services. It’s ideal for businesses requiring additional support or those that cannot afford the high cost of software developers in the United States.  Our work from home network of software developers are based in Latin American and Eastern Europe.  We hire only the top 3% of software engineers. Another benefit is the cost savings which are significant; you can pay 50%–70% less than you would here in the United States.  Would you be available for a quick 20-minute introductory call?

You were recommended by Libby Kane, director of content strategy for personal finance insider.   The series is launching this month and will feature five key pillars that we'll be populating throughout the entire year: Learn, Plan, Borrow, Invest, and Thrive.  Based on your role and current contributions to the finance discussion already, we think you’d be very beneficial to this council.  We will ask our Money Councilmembers to, at minimum: - Participate in a digital or IRL roundtable to answer and discuss questions from our audience.  - Contribute one “thought leader” article that helps millennials connect their money concerns to real solutions. - Allow us to promote their participation in the Money Council throughout the year. - When time permits, offer ideas and advice to us throughout the year as we explore topics in-depth.   We’re very excited about this new project and being able to change the conversations around money for millennials.  With that said, I’m sure you have some questions about all of this, and I'm happy to answer them. Feel free to email me (bovers@businessinsider.com) and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi Abby:  It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm working on a start up in the financial wellness space. While we're not looking to raise at the moment, we are having early conversations and would love the opportunity to connect.  Some background on my company Clasp: My co-founder Katherine and I are building a financial wellness solution designed to take a more active and emotionally-based approach to managing money. After spending over a year researching and speaking with potential users around the country, we’ve determined that you can’t build a personal finance solution without gaining an understanding of users’ emotional profile. We’re borrowing elements from mindfulness apps like Headspace and journaling apps to build a distinct approach to managing finances that is grounded in authenticity. We’ve built a feature set that challenges users to spending missions while also gaining key data points on how they’re feeling along the way, so we can better customize their journey over time.   And also, a bit more on my background: * Founded two startups prior: a retail company and web development agency * Spent two years as a Senior Engineer at Bloomberg * Spent six years as a trading analyst at Merrill Lynch * Also earned my CFA Charter  ",INBOX,,No,No

We haven't communicated in a while. Wanted to share some quick updates on my academics. I did a summer internship at Numerix, New York. They are doing exciting work in financial services and risk technology. I worked here as a software developer intern and was involved with the development of their python automation framework libraries.  I’ve also been working on my masters thesis and you’d be glad to know that it got selected for the Springer publication in an upcoming conference. So that’s good news! My team and I constructed an intelligent system that helps the user to evaluate the approval or denial of their mortgages using predicted macro and micro risk exposures.  I am going to apply for full-time positions now since I graduate in May next year. And over the last few months spent in my research, I’ve realized that risk technology and software engineering is my area of interest and expertise.

So to give you a little more color on what I’m working on: I’m building a personal finance solution that is focused on behavioral change.

Instead of boring budgets, we’re building a whole user journey where users go through various spending challenges to ultimately create real behavioral change.  Right now, I’ve been conducting a ton of user research and building out the product. However, while developing an engaging product has been top of mind, I know that positioning this product and building a real audience is critical to this venture.

I underestimated the skill, time and effort involved in actually creating a branding identity that really resonates. Since the demographic I am targeting has a high a standard of good branding, I've decided to spend the next few months working with a few branding rock stars to build a brand identity that is dynamic and identifiable. As a result, I'll be putting off the actual build out to September. Once I start building out, I'm going to resume my recruiting efforts for a Marketing Co-Founder. So perhaps in the fall you can reach out to your investors, I will of course follow up!  Until then, if you know of any really great branding experts, particularly those who have experience translating a branding vision into a visual identity, let me know!  Thanks, Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

I love all the empathy built into this prototype - makes you feel like you're not alone in struggling, which is probably why a lot of people end up tuning out and going back to their normal habits.

One woman mentioned that the voice and story behind my app is special and needs to be explained in long content like a blog article. I've also been told that paid search and paid social may be challenging for this app to really stand out since the space is crowded.  It's great that I'm hearing consistent information.

That would definitely be something I would use! Always on the look out for easy to read financial information.  I would be happy to help with your logo. What would you like on your logo? Would you like the logo to incorporate anything to do with finance, or would you rather take a different route. Please send any sketches, or examples of logos you like to speed up the design process.   Could you also tell us if you have any thoughts on the colouring and font styling for the logo? For example, would you require a modern font, something simple, or something quite bold ect?  In terms of pricing, I currently offer three logo packages aimed towards a range of business types.  •	Gold - 10 logo variations, 10 revisions, includes a free business card, letterhead and social media banners - £800 •	Silver - 5 logo variations, 5 revisions, includes a free business card and letterhead - £300 •	Bronze - 2 logo variations, 2 revisions - £100  I have attached an image which goes into further details about the packages.  What package would you prefer? As you are looking to expand later next year, it would probably best to start of with a smaller package, and then maybe go with a bigger package next year?  Please let me know if you would like any information about this? I look forward to hearing from you!

So as I mentioned we’re looking for a logo designer. We’re currently building a budgeting app geared towards millennials to create better financial and more sustainable habits. The branding on this is far from a traditional budgeting app and will be way more fun and fresh.  We’ll be launching in January with a tiny beta group (under 20 users) and then plan on launching with a wider audience after a few months of testing. We anticipate that we’ll likely redesign many aspects of the core design and branding after 6 months of testing with users (including the logo). So we’re really just looking for a minimum viable version of a logo for this first iteration.  We’ve invested a lot of time thinking about the branding direction which we’d be able to share with you.  What we’d like to know more about is your process and approach to logo design as well as a ballpark on your rates.  -Sunny,INBOX,,No,No

Your app sounds like something I would LOVE to have! This project is right up my alley, too. I’ve recently worked with two early age startups on their brand identity - SIPTIP, a customized wine delivery service for millennials, and Ning Solutions, a consulting agency. Both companies wanted a fresh and modern look, so for the logos we went for flat designs with icons that represented the personality of their brands. I also developed the larger visual identity systems for these companies - color palette, imagery selection, typography, etc.  Here is my portfolio if you want to check out my work: https://indd.adobe.com/view/93abf91f-8d4f-49b8-b3a0-a6fe7fd56679  Regarding my process, I would start by working with you to understand your brand - who your target is, what your brand’s personality is like, what message you want to send, etc. We’ll also review other logos and brands that you like/dislike, so that I understand what your aesthetic tastes are. It sounds like you’ve already put thought into this, which is great and may speed this part up, I would just want to make sure we’re on completely the same page before the designing starts.  Once we’re aligned on the vision, I’ll start designing! Depending on your budget, I usually provide up to 3 logo options for you to choose from. For each option, I can show you different color variations and mock ups so that you can envision what they’ll look like in real life applications. Once we decide on a logo, I’ll provide you all the assets and files you need. Depending on your schedule, the whole process may take around 2-4 weeks.  As for pricing, I charge up to $900 (more if you want to get into a visual identity system). Pricing will really depend on how in-depth you want to go with the above process, how detailed you want to get with the design, how many revisions or options you want to look at, how long you plan to use the logo, etc. I’m happy to work within your budget and come up with a plan that works for us both.  I hope this helps, let me know if you have other questions or want to hop on a call and chat further.  Thanks!  Alex   alholness@gmail.com www.alexandraholness.com",INBOX,,No,No

For my career before Bloomberg, I did both front end and back end--I tried to keep a good balance of both. After doing that over a few years, I slowly developed a preference.   When starting out, I always recommend newcomers to the field to take a Full Stack position so that way they get exposure to both. However, it depends on what's available and sometimes it may not be an option.

The idea is to use gamification concepts and integrating content within the experience to create better spending habits. Instead of boring budgets, I’m building a whole user journey where users go through various spending challenges to ultimately create real behavioral change. Also, I want to position it VERY differently from traditional budgeting apps—I want there to be a clever, fun and even cheeky quality to it.   Also as I mentioned, I have a vision of the kind of feelings and emotions I want users to feel from interacting with my brand, but I’m having the toughest time translating that into a visual identity that is beautiful and makes sense!

Your book “Designing for Behavior Change” is serving as a blueprint for developing my product for my startup, Zai. I'm building a personal finance app that focuses on behavioral change for millennials and their spending habits.  I spent the past 6 months interviewing millennials about their financial habits, which has led me to various hypotheses about the passive way in which millennials approach personal finance. This has informed the design of my first iteration of my prototype which I'm currently testing with users. I'd love to connect with you to show you this prototype!  A little more information about myself: • Currently, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Bloomberg • I've started two companies: Zoraab (an E-Commerce compan) and The Fresh (a web development agency) • Before my career as an engineer, I spent 5 years on Wall Street as a Credit Derivative Analyst on the trading floor at Merrill Lynch while earning my CFA charter • It is my life's mission to leverage technology to improve the financial well being of people  Let me know if you're open to continue the conversation!  -Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

Also, unlike the existing apps out there, I want to be more focused on the emotional side of spending, since that is so often ignored.  Your videos on living on a $50 budget and minimalism really resonated with me.

Everyone has been really positive and receptive with both my product and my plans to validate my hypotheses. So starting next week, I'm going to officially move forward with things. I'm going to go ahead and build out my Landing Page MVP. I'm also going to do about 20-30 user interviews in the next few weeks! I'm nervous, overwhelmed and excited all at the same time!  How about you? How are things?  -Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

Do you know the reasons why they dropped out? Would you be able to put me in contact with those who dropped out?  - Would you do DBC again?

I really am very excited for you! You'll probably be seeing me around campus as I'll be a coach!  My sister and I started Zoraab when we were both in Finance actually. I didn't have any coding background but the whole process of learning on my own as I built my site was such a fun experience for me and just affirmed that I would love being a full on developer. Initially, doing DBC was a strategic decision for the business, but the reality is that it goes way beyond just my business, but rather gaining skills that I can apply to any business.  As far as prep, of course go through in depth the prep work they give you. The truth is that the curriculum is always changing to keep up with the market, so whatever they've assigned you in phase 0 has been specifically selected to prepare you for DBC. Also I would highly recommend getting up and running with blogging. Everyone who really took advantage of blogging not only were able to really make sense of all they learned, but it proved to be very beneficial when it came to looking for jobs.  So tell me more about ur background. What made you decide to come to DBC?  -Sunny  Sent from LinkedIn for iPhone http://lnkd.in/ios  ",INBOX,,No,No

My situation was a bit different from many others who do such programs as my core intention was not to come out and work as a junior developer.  My motivation for going was to learn enough about web app development to be able to build a little bit and, more importantly, be able to work with development teams effectively.  Another program to consider is gSchool, run out of Denver.  It's actually run out of the co-working space I work from, and the current cohort (their 1st) is in their sixth week.  Seems pretty intense and I imagine all of these students will come out quite further down the road than Devbootcamp students.  Best of luck with your decisions.    Best,  Brian    ",INBOX,,No,No

I came across your profile in LinkedIn and wanted to ask you some questions about your experience in Dev Bootcamp!   A little about me:  I too come from a Finance background and actually will be taking Level 3 of the CFA exam in June-I figured I passed the first two exams so I might as well try to get the charter even though I do not plan on sticking around in the industry for long.  I work at Bank of America supporting Fixed Income trading and I also co-founded a business on the side. Based on my work at my own startup, I was able to teach myself some fundamentals in web design and coding and came to the realization that I want to actually pursue a career in programming since I enjoy it so much-which is how I came across Dev Bootcamp.  I'm thinking about enrolling in the program later this year, but I'm doing my research right now before I officially make the decision. As someone who was been through the program, what are your thoughts? Did you learn a great deal about programming? Did you find that there were ample employment opportunities for DBC grads (this is important to me since my side business is far from profitable for me to actually purse that full time!)? Would you do it again?  Thank you so much for your time, I would really appreciate your thoughts!  -Sunny",INBOX,,No,No

For those who don't want to read the entire message I'll get straight to the point. As many of you know I have been working on launching an e-commerce concept called TrendSeeder for a long time now and the time has come where you can help us really get it off the ground - this would only consist of just a minute or two of your time (literally nothing more) and would be a MASSIVE help to us. Basically all I am hoping you will do is:     1. Please request an invite by going to www.trendseeder.com . Please note this is just our landing page and we are only accepting invite requests right now. We will be launching soon at which point we will be sending out invites so people can join and browse the site. It's going to feature items for both men and women!     2. Get $25 credits by getting your friends to request invites. For every 5 people you invite who join once the site is launched, we will award you $25 off your next purchase. We made it super easy to share with your contacts, our website is set up so you can pull people in directly from your e-mail contact list or type in e-mail addresses manually if you prefer during the invite request process.     3. If you have a few extra seconds, like us on Facebook - www.facebook.com/trendseeder     4. And if you want more, follow us on Pinterest - pinterest.com/trendseeder     5. There's always Twitter as well - twitter.com/trendseeder     Thank you so much for your support and time for all who only get this far, but...... For those who want more information:       What it is: E-commerce concept designed to disrupt the existing retail model - we will be offering exclusive, limited edition items from up-and-coming designers (everything from high-end women's apparel to grown-up duffel bags for men) and curated by a panel of VERY experienced retail insiders. In a retail establishment which propagates the same old brands/styles to the masses and is very unfriendly to the newcomer, our goal is to provide a launch pad for up-and-coming designers to reach our customers (Men and Women). We want to create a unique experience for our customers and offer them something nobody else can or will.     Thank you again for your support and time, it means the world to us. We hope you get a chance to sign up and more importantly hope you enjoy what we have in store for you.     Avani",INBOX,,No,No

Things can be written in whatever language you prefer, but it is currently in Ruby and Clojure on a UNIX based system, so you'd need to be very comfortable with those languages to be considered.

My name is Jeff Kornfeld and I specialize in helping loan brokers monetize their rejected loan files.  Covid has forced more Americans to apply for financial relief. But more unqualified loan applications = more declined loans.  Taking up your time and resources to process; resulting in less productivity, less revenue, and more financial worries.  But it doesn’t have to be that way.  Value Capital Funding offers Commercial Loan Brokers a program to monetize your turned down loan files.  You could receive a $3K-$5K commission, minimum,  per rejected application. Making an extra recurring monthly revenue stream, with minimal effort.    Learn the secrets of top producing loan brokers, and don’t reinvent the wheel.  Let’s have a quick 10-15 minute chat where I’ll show you how you can make $3K-$5K per declined loan file, bolster your income, and ease your financial pressure.  Either way, have a great day!
